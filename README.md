# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Anna Adekogbe

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT) at Harvard University, where I study behavior, brain, and language using open, scalable, and inclusive methods.

### 🧠 My Research Interests
- Natural language transcription & behavioral data analysis
- Cogntive & behavioral visualization
- EEG methods and multimodal data analysis
- Data pipelines for open, replicable science

### 🧪 Current Projects
- Characterizing language in children with Down syndrome and autism
- Building an open-source behavioral data pipeline (with transcription, derived measures, EEG, & visualizations)
- Exploring speech and neurophysiological markers in diverse populations

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills
Programming & Scripting
  - Python (data analysis, plotting, basic statistics)
  - Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
Data Tools & Visualization
  - Custom visualizations using seaborn & matplotlib for research presentations and manuscripts
Speech & Behavioral Analysis Tools
  - SALT Transcription (manual annotation, tier design)
  - PRAAT (speech acoustics, audio preprocessing)
  - Novel NLS transcription protocol development (tier design and standardization)
Project Management & Mentorship
  - Team & student mentorship (undergrad & post-bac training)
  - Google Suite, Notion, Microsoft Office (documentation, slide decks, collaborative workflows)

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
- GitHub workflow & collaboration
- Data Science with Python (HarvardX Certificate, 2025–2026)
- EEG preprocessing, analysis, and visualization

### 💡 What I Value
- Equity in research participation
- Mentorship & accessible science
- Purpose-driven, people-centered tech
- Meaningfully signficant interventions for patients and families,
- Inchstones over milestones

### 📁 Repositories to Watch
